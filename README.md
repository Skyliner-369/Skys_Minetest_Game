# Skys_Minetest_Game
a project to make a minetest game where it plays like many of the best MC mopdpacks.

Warning:Heavily incomplete

To play:
	•Go to https://www.minetest.net/ and download and install a copy of Minetest.
	•Download the release as a .zip
	•Go to the location for your minetest appdata:
		•in Linux, it'll be in home as .minetest (~/.minetest)
		•in windows it'll be in AppData Roaming as Minetest (C:/Users/<YOU>/AppData/Roaming/Minetest/)
		•in any portable version (simply extracted from an archive) it'll be in the main folder.
	•Go to the games folder and extract the .zip inside.

It should show up as a Game to play in Minetest upon launch.

This should also, at some point, show up under the content browser within Minetest, meaning that Minetest can do all the heavy lifting above for you.
